# NomLog - AI Food Tracker

NomLog is an AI-powered food tracking app that helps users analyze and log meals using image recognition technology.

**Note**: This project is still a work in progress, and some features may not be fully functional.

## Features
- **Image Analysis**: Upload a photo of your meal to analyze its nutritional content using AI.
- **Meal Logging**: Categorize meals into breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks.
- **Daily Totals**: View a summary of daily calories, protein, carbs, and fats.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Implements multiple data structures to support functionality.

## Data Structures Used
This project demonstrates the use of the following data structures:
- **Lists**: Used to store individual food items and daily meal logs.
- **Queues**: Handles image processing tasks in an asynchronous queue.
- **Hash Table**: Stores nutritional data for quick lookup and retrieval.
- **Tree**: Represents hierarchical meal categorization and ingredient breakdown.
- **Graph**: Models relationships between ingredients and similar foods.

## Bonus Features
- **Searching Algorithms**: Efficiently search for foods within logs or nutritional databases.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Sort meals by calorie count, protein, or other nutritional values.
- **GUI/Visualization**: User-friendly interface for meal logging and nutritional analysis.
